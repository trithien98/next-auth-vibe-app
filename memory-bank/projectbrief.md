# Project Brief: Next.js Authentication Boilerplate

## Overview

Building a production-ready fullstack authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) boilerplate using Next.js 14. This project serves as a comprehensive starting point for applications requiring secure user authentication, permissions management, and admin functionality.

## Core Requirements

### Authentication System

- User registration with email verification
- Secure login/logout with JWT tokens
- Password reset functionality via email
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) with OTP
- Token refresh mechanism with automatic retry logic
- Token revocation and blacklisting for security

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Dynamic permission system with flexible assignment
- User roles (admin, manager, user) with inheritance
- Route-level protection (frontend and API)
- Admin panel for user and role management
- Permission-based UI rendering

### Security Features

- JWT access/refresh token rotation
- Redis-based session management and token blacklisting
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- CSRF protection
- Audit logging for administrative actions
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Zustand, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, MongoDB with Mongoose, Redis
- **Storage**: LocalForage for secure client-side token storage
- **Runtime**: Bun for fast package management and execution
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for development environment
- **Security**: JWT, 2FA, CSRF protection, input validation

## Goals

1. Create a production-ready authentication boilerplate
2. Implement comprehensive RBAC with flexible permissions
3. Ensure top-tier security practices
4. Provide excellent developer experience with Docker
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation and examples
6. Support scalable architecture patterns

## Success Criteria

- Complete authentication flow working end-to-end
- Admin panel with full user/role management
- All security features implemented and tested
- Docker development environment functional
- Comprehensive documentation for easy adoption
- Performance benchmarks meeting production standards

## Current Status

The project documentation (memory bank) has been established with comprehensive technical specifications, setup guides, API designs, security flows, and business logic documentation. The next phase involves implementing the actual codebase based on these specifications.
