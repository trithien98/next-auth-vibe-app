# Progress Tracker

## Imp### Phase 3: Authentication Core (Clean Architecture) ðŸ”„ NEXT UP

- [ ] Domain layer: User, Role, Permission entities with business logic
- [ ] Application layer: Use cases for auth operations (Register, Login, Logout)
- [ ] Interface adapters: Controllers, repositories, and presenters
- [ ] Infrastructure layer: MongoDB/Redis implementations with dependency injection
- [ ] JWT token management system with LocalForage integration
- [ ] Database models with Mongoose following repository patternion Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ… COMPLETE

- [x] Project documentation structure (consolidated in Memory Bank)
- [x] Memory Bank initialization with complete methodology
- [x] Technology stack finalization (Bun + LocalForage + Docker)
- [x] Security architecture documentation
- [x] API design and data models
- [x] Documentation consolidation (removed /docs folder, Memory Bank only)

### Phase 2: Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETE

- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with App Router
- [x] Configure Bun package management (all dependencies installed)
- [x] Set up Docker Compose environment (MongoDB, Redis, MailDev)
- [x] Configure MongoDB and Redis containers with health checks
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration with path mappings
- [x] Initialize TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui configuration
- [x] Create project directory structure (auth, dashboard, components)
- [x] Configure Prettier and ESLint
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env.local)
- [x] Verify development server working with Bun

### Phase 3: Authentication Core ï¿½ NEXT UP

- [ ] JWT token management system with LocalForage integration
- [ ] Database models (User, Role, Permission, Session) with Mongoose
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] Login/logout functionality with token management
- [ ] Password reset flow with secure tokens
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism with automatic rotation

### Phase 4: RBAC Implementation ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

- [ ] Permission system architecture
- [ ] Role management (admin, manager, user)
- [ ] Route protection middleware
- [ ] Admin panel for user management
- [ ] Permission-based UI rendering

### Phase 5: Security Features ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Audit logging system
- [ ] Session management with Redis

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation finalization
- [ ] Production deployment guide

## Current Sprint: Authentication Core Implementation

### Today's Goals

1. âœ… Initialize Next.js 14 project structure
2. âœ… Configure Bun as package manager
3. âœ… Set up Docker Compose environment
4. âœ… Verify all tools are working correctly

### Completed This Session

- Full Next.js 14 project setup with App Router
- Complete dependency installation using Bun
- Docker Compose configuration with MongoDB, Redis, and MailDev
- TypeScript configuration with proper path mappings
- TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui setup with theme configuration
- Project directory structure following best practices
- Environment configuration for development
- Development server verification (working correctly)

### Next Session Goals

1. Create database models (User, Role, Permission, Session)
2. Implement JWT token management system
3. Set up LocalForage for secure client-side storage
4. Build user registration API endpoint

### Blockers/Issues

- None currently identified

### Decisions Made

- Using Bun instead of npm/yarn for better performance
- LocalForage for secure client-side token storage
- Docker Compose for development environment
- MongoDB + Redis for data layer

### Next Session Prep

- Have Docker Desktop running
- Ensure Bun is installed globally
- Review Next.js 14 App Router documentation
