# Active Context: Current Development State

## Current Focus

**Phase**: RBAC Implementation (Clean Architecture)
**Status**: Authentication core complete, transitioning to RBAC features

## Recent Changes

1. **Consolidated all documentation into Memory Bank structure**:
   - Removed separate `/docs` folder in favor of comprehensive Memory Bank
   - All technical, security, and setup information now in Memory Bank files
   - Streamlined documentation approach using Cline methodology

2. **Updated technology stack** to use modern tooling:
   - **Bun integration**: Replaced npm/yarn/pnpm with Bun for faster development
   - **LocalForage implementation**: Secure client-side storage with fallback support
   - **Docker Compose setup**: Complete containerized development environment
   - **Multi-stage Docker builds**: Production-ready containerization

3. **Implemented complete Cline Memory Bank structure** for persistent context:
   - ✅ `projectbrief.md` - Core project overview and requirements
   - ✅ `productContext.md` - Business context and user stories
   - ✅ `activeContext.md` - Current development state (this file)
   - ✅ `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns and conventions
   - ✅ `progress.md` - Implementation roadmap and sprint tracking
   - ✅ `decisions.md` - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - ✅ `codePatterns.md` - Code standards and templates
   - ✅ `integrations.md` - Dependencies and integration points
   - ✅ `testing.md` - Testing strategy and patterns

4. **Completed Phase 2: Environment Setup** ✅ COMPLETE:
   - ✅ Next.js 14 project initialized with App Router
   - ✅ Bun package manager configured with all dependencies
   - ✅ Docker Compose environment set up (MongoDB, Redis, MailDev)
   - ✅ TypeScript configuration with path mappings
   - ✅ TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui integrated
   - ✅ Project directory structure created
   - ✅ Development server verified working

5. **Architecture Decision: Clean Architecture** ✅ DOCUMENTED:
   - ✅ Clean Architecture layers defined (Domain, Application, Interface Adapters, Frameworks)
   - ✅ Directory structure planned for separation of concerns
   - ✅ Code patterns documented for entities, use cases, repositories
   - ✅ Dependency injection pattern established
   - ✅ Business logic isolation from frameworks

## Memory Bank Status

The Cline Memory Bank methodology is now fully implemented with 9 comprehensive files:

### Core Context Files ✅

- **Project Brief**: Complete project overview with goals and success criteria
- **Product Context**: Business flows, user personas, and feature requirements
- **Active Context**: Current development state and next steps (this file)
- **System Patterns**: Architecture patterns and coding conventions

### Development Support Files ✅

- **Progress Tracker**: Phase-based roadmap with sprint planning
- **Decision Log**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices
- **Code Patterns**: Naming conventions, file structures, and code templates
- **Integration Points**: Dependencies, APIs, and service connections
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing patterns and frameworks

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Implement Domain Layer** - Create User, Role, Permission entities with business logic
2. **Build Application Layer** - Implement use cases (RegisterUser, LoginUser, LogoutUser)
3. **Create Interface Adapters** - Controllers, repositories, and presenters
4. **Set up Infrastructure Layer** - MongoDB repositories and dependency injection
5. **Integrate JWT + LocalForage** - Token management with clean architecture
6. **Build API endpoints** - Next.js routes using clean architecture controllers

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made

- **Bun over Node.js**: Chosen for 3x faster package installation and built-in TypeScript support
- **LocalForage over direct IndexedDB**: Provides automatic fallback and better browser compatibility
- **Docker-first development**: Ensures consistent environment across developers
- **Next.js App Router**: Modern approach for better performance and developer experience

### Architecture Patterns

- **Token storage strategy**: Access tokens in LocalForage, refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies
- **State management**: Zustand with persistence for lightweight, TypeScript-friendly state
- **API design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling and validation
- **Security approach**: Defense in depth with multiple layers of protection

### Current Implementation Strategy

1. **Documentation-driven development**: Comprehensive specs guide implementation
2. **Security-first approach**: Implement auth and security before features
3. **Docker development**: Use containers for consistent environment
4. **Test-driven mindset**: Plan for >95% test coverage from start

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization

```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                # Utilities and configurations
├── stores/             # Zustand state management
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
└── utils/              # Helper functions
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Docker Compose** for local development environment
2. **Bun** for package management and script execution
3. **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
4. **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
5. **Conventional commits** for clear history

### Security Patterns

- **JWT with refresh rotation**: Short-lived access tokens with secure refresh
- **Permission-based authorization**: Granular control over resources
- **Audit logging**: Track all sensitive operations
- **Rate limiting**: Protect against abuse and attacks

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Documentation Benefits

- Comprehensive upfront documentation prevents confusion during implementation
- Mermaid diagrams effectively communicate complex flows
- Structured API design docs enable parallel frontend/backend development
- Security-focused documentation ensures no critical features are missed

### Technology Integration Insights

- Bun's speed advantages are significant for development workflow
- LocalForage provides excellent developer experience with storage
- Docker Compose eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- Next.js 14 App Router requires mindful state management patterns

### Development Process Observations

- Memory Bank methodology provides excellent context preservation
- Comprehensive specs reduce implementation time and errors
- Security-first approach prevents costly refactoring later
- Modern tooling (Bun, Docker) significantly improves developer experience

## Context for Implementation

The project is ready to move from planning/documentation phase to active implementation. All architectural decisions have been made, technology stack is defined, and comprehensive documentation exists to guide development. The next session should focus on initializing the actual codebase and setting up the development environment.
