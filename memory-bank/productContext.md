# Product Context: Authentication & RBAC Boilerplate

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Being Solved

Most fullstack applications require authentication and authorization, but implementing these systems securely and comprehensively is time-consuming and error-prone. Developers often:

- Reinvent authentication wheels with security vulnerabilities
- Struggle with complex permission systems and role management
- Lack proper token management and session security
- Need extensive time to set up development environments
- Miss critical security features like 2FA, audit logging, and rate limiting

### Target Users

- **Fullstack Developers** building SaaS applications, internal tools, or client projects
- **Development Teams** needing a secure, scalable authentication foundation
- **Startup CTOs** requiring production-ready auth without extensive development time
- **Enterprise Developers** needing compliance-ready audit trails and security features

## How The Product Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Developers (Primary Users)

1. **Quick Setup**: `git clone` → `docker-compose up` → working auth system
2. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for customization and extension
3. **Modern Stack**: Latest Next.js, TypeScript, modern tooling (Bun, Docker)
4. **Security by Default**: All security best practices implemented out-of-the-box
5. **Extensible**: Easy to customize roles, permissions, and UI components

#### For End Users (Application Users)

1. **Smooth Onboarding**: Simple registration with email verification
2. **Secure Access**: Strong password requirements, optional 2FA
3. **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, responsive UI with dark/light mode
4. **Account Management**: Profile updates, password changes, activity history
5. **Admin Experience**: Powerful admin panel for user/role management

### Core Workflows

#### Authentication Flow

1. User registers → email verification → account activation
2. Login with credentials → optional 2FA → token issuance
3. Automatic token refresh → session management → secure logout
4. Password reset via email with secure token validation

#### Authorization Flow

1. Role assignment during registration or by admin
2. Permission checking at route and API levels
3. Dynamic UI rendering based on user permissions
4. Admin management of roles and permissions

#### Security Flow

1. All sensitive actions logged for audit trail
2. Failed login attempts tracked and rate limited
3. Suspicious activity detection and response
4. Token revocation for security incidents
